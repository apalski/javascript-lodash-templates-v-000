# Hooroo Academy Application Questions from Annette Drapalski

## Q.1. Why Programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

My previous career in manufacturing had become stale and I was no longer feeling as motivated as I should. It was time for a change
but I wanted to be passionate about my next career and I wanted it to engage and intrigue me and make me look forward to each day. 

I remembered dabbling in programming years ago and really enjoying it, so I started to do some research into what programming 
would mean today. Web Development ticked all my boxes - it was relevant, fun, absorbing, constantly evolving and future-proof. 
I am currently 75% through a Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp, online, through Flatiron School in New York. The course is self-paced 
and would adapt easily to part-time study to allow me to take on full-time work. I have just completed the Ruby on Rails(RoRs) section 
of the course and really love programming with Ruby and Rails, it just flows. The next part of the course is JavaScript, React and Redux and I am 33% through the JavaScript section. My GitHub repositories are [here](https://github.com/apalski?tab=repositories).

## Q.2. If you are accepted into our programme, what would you like to get out of it? What would success look like for you?

As much learning as possible, while I have become quite good with RoR I know I have so much more to learn. I want to be exposed to as 
many different ways of thinking as possible so that I can become the most succinct, clear and logical programmer I can. A big part of 
the attraction of programming is that there is always something to learn and great people to learn it with. I want to be surrounded by a happy, diverse, giving and talented group of people who will inspire and charge me and allow me to do the same for them as I gain   experience.

Success to me means happiness, fulfillment and giving back. On the whole I feel I am already fairly successful as I have found my why in programming and am happy and content in my personal life. I believe you can always grow existing success through interactions with 
others, in working with a happy and successful team and in helping and mentoring others.

## Q.3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

While I have made many mistakes in my working life I have been fortunate that none of them were major and all were able to be turned 
into success. That none were major was in large part due to being surrounded by a wonderful team of people who looked out for each 
other, including me, their boss. I think the key was always being part of my team and not above my team and also being able to admit mistakes and shortcomings so as to continue to grow and learn. On analyzing where many of my mistakes came from I arrived at the need 
for a more robust 'to-do' system, while I had a 'to-do' list I wasn't diligent in keeping it relevant and updated. The position could be   highly stressful and very fast paced and it was easy to allow myself to buy into the idea that I didn't have time for everything when in fact it was more about time management and being more proactive. Once I faced this I was able to restructure the role and activities and even found spare time for additional projects.

The key takeaways for me were to always stand back from a situation and view it dispassionately and then look for the opportunities for change and improvement. Also, to be kind to myself and recognise the things that I do well and find ways to improve the things I am not 
so good at. I am proud to say that I have always been good within a team and in leading a team, I always give my team the credit and always take the blame when things don't go as planned. The one thing I had to improve as a team leader was delegating, I was always worried about overloading people but in reality most people want more responsibility and want to be able to contribute more to their team.

## Q.4.  Why are you interested in joining Hooroo? How do you relate to Hoorooâ€™s purpose and value?

I am looking for a company that will value me and my contribution but still hold me accountable for my work and input. Hooroo presents 
as a workplace that encourages individuality, diversity and team work. The opportunities for learning and growth in the apprenticeship  phase and in full-time roles is very attractive. Overall, I love the feel that I get about Hooroo and its culture and values.

Whenever I get the opportunity to travel I take it and so far I have visited 22 countries as well as having travelled extensively within Australia. When I travel it varies from back-packing to 5-star using planes, trains, buses and ships. I love talking about travel and planning trips, I mainly do all my own travel bookings and have used many different online sites and tools. I would really enjoy working with Hooroo to provide diverse, quality accomodation options around the world for its customers. I know that Hooroo is looking to 
provide the best experience possible for its customers when they interact with the Qantas and Jetstar sites and my travel experience 
would give me an insight into what people are looking for in a travel site.
